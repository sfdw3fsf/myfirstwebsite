                <p><br/>The weather is unusual on the Grand Line to say the least, the standard rules of meteorology donâ€™t apply. The ocean currents and weather patterns are extremely volatile and inconsistent, they can drastically change in an instant;
                    this includes water spouts, storms, blizzards, heat waves, thick fog, and many other such things.[13]<br/> There are also cyclones that seem to appear quickly and suddenly, they are remarked as being impossible to predict.[14]</p>

                <p><br/>The Grand Line is the gigantic sea route that circles around the planet, stretching <br/>from west to east.[4] It follows a n imaginary line that runs from north-west to south-east across the middle of the world <br/>and perpendicular
                    to the Red Line, a vast ring-like continent that circles the globe from north-east to south-west.[5][6] The Grand Line is placed similarly to the equator. In fact, the main importance of the Grand Line is that it is the only way to
                    circumnavigate the globe.[5]<br/> The Grand Line and the Red Line crossing each other is what divides the rest of the Blue Sea into four oceans[7]: the N orth Blue, the East Blue, the West Blue, and the South Blue.[7] As such, they
                    are key to worldwide<br/> trade and travel in that the Lines are placed along the paths between the Blues. This makes them valuable routes of travel and obstacles for both pirates and civilians alike.[citation needed]</p>

                <h1>Navigation</h1>
                <p><br/>A normal compass wont work on the Grand Line due to each island generating its own magnetic field.<br/> In order to navigate the Grand Line, one needs a special type of compass known as a Log Pose. The Log Pose works by locking on
                    to the magnetism produced by one island and points toward that island. After reaching said island and staying there for a certain amount of time,<br/> the Log Pose will reset and start locking on to the magnetism of the next island.
                    The time it takes for a Log Pose to set i s different on each island; it may take a few hours, it may take a few days, or even a full year.[16][17]</p>

                gifted it to t he boy as part of a promise for them to meet again someday. Luffy is the son of the Revolutionary leader <br/>Monkey D. Dragon,[28] th e grandson of the Marine hero Monkey D. Garp,[29] the sworn brother of the late "Fire
